# About

NC Games is a platform where users can vote and comment on several game reviews.
- The user can open and view any review but only vote for the ones they have not written or already voted for.
- The user can also comment on any review as long as the comment contains at least one character, they can delete their comments as well.
- They're also able to choose how to sort and order the reviews and can see them within a specific category.
- By default the user will be logged as happyamy2016, a future improvement would be adding a login system with more options.
- Another improvement would be extending the voting system to comments.
- Lastly, I'd also consider adding a profile for each user with details on their interactions within the platform such as reviews they've voted for and commented on, as well as a profile picture that could be shown on either the reviews or the comments made by them.

# Tech Used

This app uses NodeJS and has an MVC architecture. The models and controllers are part of the back-end. The view was built with React and also uses JSX (which has similarities with HTML), the styling was done using CSS.

# Final words

Thanks for viewing my first software development project, done as part of the Northcoders bootcmap program. I had great pleasure in making it and am overall satisfied with the end result, although I'm a strong believer that there's always space for improvement. Having my sister trying the app and complaining about having to scroll extensively has made me decide to fix the navigation buttons and opt for a grid layout on bigger screens per example. So I'm very glad I got that feedback and other people can now have a different experience.  With that being said, I'm very open to criticism, please don't hesitate in reaching out!
